# PyLanders
A port of PyLanders to Python3

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Python 3.x and `pip` installed. To install the dependencies, do:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the `main.py` file as:

```
Then select if you want to load more chunks than the default, and your world. If it does not exist, you will need to select a generator.
