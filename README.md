# PyLanders
A port of PyLanders to Python3

## Prerequisites
You will need to have Python 3.x and `pip` installed. To install the dependencies, do:

Linux/Unix/MacOS:
```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Windows:
```bat
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Run the `main.py` file as:
Linux/Unix/MacOS:
```sh
python3 ./main.py
```
Windows:
```bat
python main.py
```
Then select if you want to load more chunks than the default, and your world. If it does not exist, you will need to select a generator.
